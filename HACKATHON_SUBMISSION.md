## üìù Submission Form Answers

### Project Name
Punto - Decentralized Post-Event Zines

### Tagline
Transform event memories into collaborative, onchain publications with trustless contributor payments.

### Description (Short)
Punto enables event organizers to create post-event zines with smart contract escrow. Contributors submit content, editors vote to approve, and payments auto-release onchain - no manual transfers needed.

### Description (Long)
After attending amazing events, communities want to capture collective memories and reward contributors. But current solutions rely on manual coordination, broken payment promises, and centralized platforms.

Punto solves this with a decentralized platform built on Base that:
1. Auto-scrapes event data from Luma/Social Layer
2. Deploys smart contract escrow for bounty funds
3. Enables transparent editorial voting
4. Auto-releases payments when submissions are approved

The key innovation is trustless auto-payments - when an editor votes to approve a submission and the threshold is reached, the smart contract immediately releases payment to the contributor. No manual transfers, no delays, no trust required.

Built with Base, Basenames, and OnchainKit for seamless onchain identity and transactions.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, OnchainKit
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Blockchain:** Base Sepolia, Solidity 0.8.20, Viem
- **Identity:** Basenames, OnchainKit Wallet
- **External APIs:** Luma, Social Layer

### What makes it unique?
First platform with automatic payment release on editorial approval. No manual payment coordination, no trust required - the smart contract handles everything.

### Target users?
Event organizers running 10-100 person events who want to capture collective memories and reward contributors without manual payment coordination.

### Future plans?
1. Multi-signature editorial voting
2. IPFS storage for submissions
3. NFT minting for published work
4. Mainnet deployment
5. DAO governance for platform
