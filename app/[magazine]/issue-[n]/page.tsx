We discuss how technology mediates our relationship with memory and how the digital realm creates new forms of intimacy and distance.\n\nThe future is already here, but it's unevenly distributed. We find ourselves caught between nostalgia for a past that never quite existed and anxiety about a future we can barely imagine.",

    content: "Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI opened at the de Young Museum in San Francisco on February 12, 2020, just weeks before the pandemic would fundamentally alter our relationship with technology and each other.\n\nThe exhibition's title refers to the unsettling feeling we experience when confronted with robots or AI that appear almost, but not quite, human. This gap-the uncanny valley-becomes a metaphor for our contemporary condition, caught between the organic and the synthetic, the real and the simulated.\n\nWhat does it mean to be human in an age where machines can generate art, compose music, and write poetry? The exhibition doesn't offer easy answers, but instead presents a series of provocations that force us to confront our assumptions about consciousness, creativity, and what makes us uniquely human.",

Or perhaps more accurately, when does art become merely commercial?\n\nThese boundaries have always been porous. We discuss the history of artists working on commission, from Renaissance masters to contemporary designers. The difference today is the speed and scale of production, the constant pressure to monetize creativity.\n\nYet there's something liberating in this ambiguity. By refusing to draw strict lines between art and commerce, we open up new possibilities for practice, new ways of thinking about value and meaning in creative work.",

Now, emptied of their human occupants, they reveal something else: the melancholy beauty of functional architecture stripped of its function.\n\nThe photographs don't mourn or celebrate these spaces. They simply observe, allowing the viewer to project their own feelings about labor, obsolescence, and the future of work onto these vacant rooms.",

The harsh angles and exposed materials become a canvas for light and shadow, creating compositions that are both geometric and deeply emotional.",
